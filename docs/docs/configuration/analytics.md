# Analytics

We collect analytics about Tracetest usage. We use it to understand how users interact with it and how we can improve the project. It's on by default, but you can disable it.

#### Example

**Analytics Enabled**

```yaml
googleAnalytics:
    enabled: true
```

**Analytics Disabled**

```yaml
googleAnalytics:
    enabled: false
```
